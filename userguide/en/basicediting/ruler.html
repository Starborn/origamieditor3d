<h1>Ruler</h1>
<p>The Ruler is the default tool for editing an origami. It appears in the <a href="3dview.html">3D View</a> as a red line. It is also displayed on the <a href="creasepattern.html">Crease Pattern</a>, revealing the folding lines corresponding to the Ruler's current position.

<p>The Ruler can be activated by <b>right clicking</b> on the 3D View, and it can be fixed by moving the mouse somewhere else and <b>right clicking</b> again. After that, a small menu will pop up that looks like this:

<p>What the <b>Rotate</b> and <b>Cut</b> commands do may be fairly obvious, but the <b>Reflect</b> command is much more complicated than it may seem. It is explained in <a href="reflectiontool.html">this chapter</a> in detail.

<p>The correct usage of the Ruler boils down to the following steps:

<ol>
 <li>Decide what lines you want to crease along.</li>
 <li>If necessary, use dragging in the 3D View to rotate the model into the correct orientation. A correct orientation is where all the new folding lines you want to add seem to line up perfectly into one straight line.</li>
 <li>Right click on a point you want the folding line to go through.</li>
 <li>Move the cursor around and decide where to set the Ruler.</li>
 <li>Take a look at the red lines in the Crease Pattern view and check if the folding lines you wanted are really there.</li>
 <li>Right click again to fix the Ruler in its final position.</li>
</ol>

<p>The precision of the Ruler is enhanced by the Snap options. By default, the Ruler will be snapped to all corners of the paper, every vertex and every midpoint.
<p>The Ruler can be deactivated by <b>left clicking</b> on the 3D View.
